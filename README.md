# Data Structures

A (work-in-progress) reference guide for data structures and algorithms I come across, updated
whenever I learn and apply new concept (like before job interviews ðŸ™‚).

I've been using python for these since the syntax is very minimal and easy to understand for small
concepts, but these can be applied to any other languages quite easily most of hte time.

## Linear Data structures

- Traditional Arrays/Lists/ArrayLists
- Linked list
- Stack
- Queue

## Trees

- Tree
- Binary tree
    - Binary search tree
        - Traditional BST
        - AVL tree
        - Red-black tree
    - Array-based heap

## Algorithms

- Heapsort
- Hashing

## Other

- Set
- Graph
    - Kruskalâ€™s algorithm
    - Prims' Algorithm
